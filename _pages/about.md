## About Me

Iâ€™m a naturopathic physician and former professor, now training to be a data analyst and data scientist. 

My interests include the application of data visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling to improve medical practice and health outcomes, and to advance medical knowledge. 

In particular, I have interests in precision medicine (especially using metabolomic data) and real-time monitoring of physiology through non-invasive biosensors (using thermal, electrical, and optical data).
