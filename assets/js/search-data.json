            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .

          "content": "About Me . I’m a naturopathic physician and former professor, now training to be a data analyst and data scientist. . My interests include the application of data visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling to improve medical practice and health outcomes, and to advance medical knowledge. . In particular, I have interests in precision medicine (especially using metabolomic data) and real-time monitoring of physiology through non-invasive biosensors (using thermal, electrical, and optical data). . Background . I have practiced as a primary care naturopathic physician since 1998, focusing primarily on offering integrative care for patients with a variety of chronic health conditions. . For much of that time, I served as an Assistant Professor of Naturopathic Medicine at the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in Portland, Oregon. There, I taught various courses in the basic medical sciences (physiology, pharmacology and herbal pharmacology, pathology), evidence-based medicine, and neuroendocrinology. I also attended to patients and supervised students in the university’s outpatient teaching clinics. And through NUNM’s Helfgott Research Institute, I participated in evidence-based research and mentored students. . My primary clinical and research activities have been focused around whole-systems biology and integrative medicine, specifically in understanding how physiological self-regulation (salutogenesis) is mediated through the neuroendocrine-immune and organ systems. I have explored the potential of micronutrient (vitamins, minerals, therapeutic metals) and herbal therapies (both “Western” and East Asian herbal therapies) in helping to restore homeodynamic balance in chronic diseases. . For the past 2 years, I have completed additional training in data analytics/data science, machine learning, software engineering, and database management. . From my years of practice as a primary care physician, I have come to believe that advances in biosensing, real-time monitoring of physiology, and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize clinical care. I have felt a strong desire to pivot from clinical practice to data science so that I can directly contribute to this developing field of study. . Skills: Data Analysis &amp; Data Science . Data gathering, storage, cleaning, visualization, and stastistical analysis; predictive modeling using supervised and unsupervised machine learning and AI . Python (including NumPy, Pandas, Matplolib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) | R | SQL | Tableau | Git/Github (version control) | . Software Development . Full stack web development . HTML5/CSS3 | Javascript (including Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose/MongoDB, React.js) | .",
